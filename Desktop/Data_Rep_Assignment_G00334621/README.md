# Brief History
Eliza is a language processing computer program. It was created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. Eliza was developed to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man
and machine. Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology. Eliza gave
users an illusion of having real life conversation with another human being.
